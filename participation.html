        <p>Scout and parent participation is crucial to the success of Troop 370.  Learning, leadership, and advancement opportunities abound for Scouts.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Troop 370 has weekly meetings, goes on monthly campouts, attends multiple summer camps, leads dozens of Eagle Scout service projects, and enjoys multiple high adventure opportunities throughout the year. We encourage every youth scout and adult scouter to participate in these wonderful opportunities provided by the Troop. Learn more about our campouts and other events at the <a href="camps-adventure.html">Camps/High Adventure</a>and <a href="campout-schedule-local-events.html">Campout Schedule</a>pages</p>
        <p>Troop 370 is a boy-led troop, meaning that while the adult scouters perform administrative duties, the scouts plan activities and campouts. Scouts have the opportunity to take up leadership positions in the troop. While leadership positions are required for advancement, the level of the position is mostly optional. There are a multitude of leadership positions available for scouts to hold. Other than the required leadership for advancement, the level of scout participation for leadership is up to him.</p>
        <p>Advancement moves at the pace of the scout, so he can move as quickly or as slowly as he wants or as time permits. Troop instructors and assistant scoutmasters are happy to help any scout with the advancement requirements. </p>
        <p>Overall, there are many opportunities for fun, service, and leadership at the Troop, and scouts can participate in as many or as few things as they would like!</p>
        <p>For parents, there are many ways in which you can assist through volunteer efforts.  There is no greater joy than joining your Scout through their Troop 370 experience, and working to support the Troop "behind the scenes".  If you would like to see how you can help, please contact the Troop, attend a meeting, or check out the "What Can I Do?" link in the password protected members section of the site.  Meetings are held most Wednesday evenings from 7:30 - 9:00PM in the St. James UMC activities building.</p>
        <p>Using the drop-down menu under "Scout/Parent Info" above, you will find forms, helpful information, and other common documents that you will find helpful during your journey through Scouts at Troop 370.</p>
