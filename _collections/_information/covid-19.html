    <p>14 March 2020 at 3:08 PM</p>
    <p>TO: Troop 370<br>
    FROM: John Buehner, Troop Committee Chair</p>
    <p>As noted earlier, the Spring Camporee (March 20-22) has been cancelled, and the Troop has cancelled Wednesday night meetings for March 18 and March 25 (consistent with APS school closures). For the April 1 meeting, the Troop will follow the schedule set by APS (that is, if APS closes, the Troop will not meet). As of now, the Troop is still planning to deliver pine straw on March 28, and we are still planning to go hiking and mountain bike riding in Cloudland Canyon on April 18-19.</p>
    <p>St. James UMC has cancelled its Activities Building events.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, Monday's Troop Committee will he held as a conference call (March 16th at 6:30 PM). Connection information has been sent in an email and posted to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/126169727423188/">Facebook group</a>.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:28px;margin-bottom:-14px;">Camporee Update</h2>
    <p>12 March 2020 at 11:30 PM</p>
    <p>TO: Troop 370<br>
    FROM: Bill Peck, Phoenix Distrct Chairman</p>
    <p>On behalf of the Phoenix District, we made the decision to cancel the Phoenix District Camporee.</p>
    <p>This decision was made shortly after Governor Kemp’s comments to Georgia’s educational community urging that they consider closing.</p>
    <p>The health and welfare of the scouts in the Phoenix District are a core responsibility for the Council, District, and Unit leaders and volunteers. Accordingly, we made the difficult decision to cancel the District Camporee that was scheduled for March 21 and 22.</p>
    <p>Please do what you can do to keep your families safe and healthy.</p>

    Phoenix District Chairman</p>
